        <li>Computers are getting smarter all the time.  Scientists tell us that soon they will be able to talk to us.  (And by ‘they’, I mean ‘computers’.  I doubt scientists will ever be able to talk to us.)</li>
        <li>I’ve noticed lately that the paranoid fear of computers becoming intelligent and taking over the world has almost entirely disappeared from the common culture.  Near as I can tell, this coincides with the release of MS-DOS.</li>
        <li>The question of whether computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can swim.</li>
        <li>It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes.  You know, less than a compact disc.  The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute.</li>
        <li>The city’s central computer told you?  R2D2, you know better than to trust a strange computer!</li>
